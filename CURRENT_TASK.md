## Next Milestone Preparation

### Real Map Integration Priority
The next major feature should be real map integration to replace the simulated map with actual geographic data and routing. This will provide:

1. **Visual Impact** - Real maps are more impressive in demos
2. **Functional Value** - Actual directions and routing
3. **User Trust** - Professional mapping increases credibility
4. **Competitive Edge** - Most trip planners lack optimized routing

### Demo Script Updates
With the new discovery features, the demo script should highlight:
1. **Network Effects** - Show how users discover and copy trips
2. **Social Proof** - Demonstrate ratings and community engagement
3. **Viral Growth** - Explain how public sharing drives adoption
4. **Complete Ecosystem** - From discovery to creation to sharing

## Blockers & Considerations

### Map Integration Decisions
- **OpenStreetMap**: Free but requires more setup
- **Mapbox**: Better features but has usage limits
- **Google Maps**: Most familiar but expensive

### Performance Considerations
- Large map libraries may impact bundle size
- Real-time routing requires external API calls
- Mobile performance with complex maps

### User Privacy
- Public trip sharing requires privacy controls
- Location data handling compliance
- User consent for public visibility

The application now has a complete discovery ecosystem that demonstrates network effects and viral growth potential - perfect for hackathon judging criteria!
